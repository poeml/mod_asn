Release Notes/Change History
============================

1.2
-----------------

* :program:`asn_get_routeviews` script:

  - download data from the `mirror`__ provided by the MirrorBrain project, so
    routeviews.org doesn't get additional traffic by additional users
    downloading from them

__ http://mirrorbrain.org/routeviews/

* the documentation has been moved into a docs subdirectory, and rewritten in
  reStructured Text format, from which HTML is be generated via Sphinx
  (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/). When the documentation is changed in subversion,
  the changes automatically get online on http://mirrorbrain.org/mod_asn/docs/

1.1
-----------------

* mod_asn.c: 

  - bump version (1.1)
  - update year in copyright header

* :program:`asn_import` script:

  - be able to read config from :file:`/etc/asn_import.conf` or
    :file:`/etc/mirrorbrain.conf`; thus, the script doesn't need to be edited
    any longer with database configuration data and credentials.

    1. if a MirrorBrain config file is found, it is used (and the MirrorBrain
       instance can be selected with -b on the commandline, if needed) 
    2. alternatively, the script looks for a config file named
       :file:`/etc/asn_import.conf`.

* :program:`asn_get_routeviews` script:

  - handle the slightly changed format of routeviews data
  - more sanity checks for parsing newer routing data

* INSTALL:

  - add links to binaries for Debian and ebuilds for Gentoo
  - add instructions for troubleshooting and testing
  - correct a wrong example of loading mod_asn instead of mod_dbd
  - added example for cron snippet for updating the routing database
  - documentation about the newly supported config file

* add debian subdirectory for building Debian packages


1.0
-----------------

* mod_asn.c:

  - fix bug that lead to ignorance of variables in the subprocess environment
    set by ``ASIPEnvvar``, which falsely looked for the wrong variable name (one
    that was configured via ``ASIPHeader``).

* document an example how to log the looked up data
