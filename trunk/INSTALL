Install the PostgreSQL ip4r datatype
-----------------------------------

* install the postgresql-ip4r package
  project page: http://ip4r.projects.postgresql.org/
  openSUSE/SLE rpm package: 
     http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/database:/postgresql/


* install the datatype, done by executing sql statements from the shipped file:
    su - postgres
    psql -f /usr/share/postgresql-ip4r/ip4r.sql template1

  ("template1" means that all databases that are created later will have the datatype.
  To install it onto an existing database, use your database name instead.)

  (It is normal to see a a good screenful of out printed out by psql.)


Create the database table
-----------------------------------

* it is assumed that a database exist already.

* execute the sql statements from asn.sql (shipping with mod_asn):
    psql -U <dbuser> -f asn.sql <dbname>

  In this example, a table named pfx2asn would be created in the 
  <dbname>. database.

  (It is normal to see a "NOTICE" printed out by psql.)



Load the database with routing data
-----------------------------------

* edit asn_import.py for database connection data 
  (hostname, username, password, ...)
  FIXME: it is ugly to have to edit a script.

* download the data and import it into the database:

    ./asn_get_routeviews.py | ./asn_import.py

* this will take a few minutes. The routing data is 900 MB uncompressed
  (beginning of 2009). 

* the same command can also be used to update the database later, with fresh
  routeviews data. Just run it again. It can be done in production while the
  database is in active use.

* you should set up this script to run once per week by cron, so the database
  keeps updated regularly.


Build the Apache module
-----------------------------------

* compile, install, and enable it:
    apxs2 -ci mod_asn.c

* or install openSUSE/SLE RPM package from here:
  http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/ 

* and enable it
    a2enmod asn

Configure Apache - mod_dbd
-----------------------------------

* mod_dbd is the database adapter that provides a connection pool.
  Put the following configuration into server-wide context.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # whis configures the connection pool.
  # for prefork, this configuration is inactive. prefork simply uses 1
  # connection per child.
  <IfModule !prefork.c>
          DBDMin  0
          DBDMax  32
          DBDKeep 4
          DBDExptime 10
  </IfModule>
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

* configure the database driver.

  Put this configuration into server-wide OR vhost context. Make the file
  chmod 0640, owned root:root because it will contain the database password.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DBDriver pgsql
  # note that the connection string (which is passed straight through to
  # PGconnectdb in this case) looks slightly different - pass vs. password
  DBDParams "host=localhost user=mb password=12345 dbname=mb_samba connect_timeout=15"
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Configure Apache - mod_asn
-----------------------------------

* simply set "ASLookup On" in the directory context where you want it.
* the shipped config (mod_asn.conf) shows an example.

* set "ASSetHeaders Off" if you don't want the data to be added to the HTTP
  response headers.

* you may use the ASLookupQuery directive (server-wide context) to define a
  custom SQL query. The compiled in default is:
  SELECT pfx, asn FROM pfx2asn WHERE pfx >>= ip4r(%s) ORDER BY ip4r_size(pfx) LIMIT 1


That's it!
